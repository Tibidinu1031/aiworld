# Neura Island / Insula Neura

A 3D adventure game where kids (around age 10) learn how artificial intelligence and machine learning work. You play as **Bip**, a friendly robot whose brain was scrambled by a storm. **Professor Ada**, a hologram teacher, guides you across 13 learning islands. Each island teaches one layer of how AI works. Pass its test to earn a Knowledge Core, light up a ring of the Core Tower, and unlock the bridge to the next island.

Everything is available in **English** and **Romanian**, at **three difficulty levels**.

## Play

**Easiest:** double-click `index.html` (the one at the top of the repository). The whole game is that one file; no server or install is needed. (An internet connection only adds the nicer fonts.)

**Best browser:** Microsoft Edge. It has natural-sounding voices for reading lessons aloud in both English and Romanian (Chrome and Firefox usually only have robotic voices, and often no Romanian one). You can pick the voice in the in-game Menu.

**For development:**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173. The development server runs the source in `src/` (its entry is `src/index.html`). `npm run build` bundles everything into the playable `index.html` at the repository root.

Progress is saved automatically in the browser (localStorage).

## Publish on GitHub Pages

The playable game is the `index.html` at the root of the repository, so GitHub Pages can serve it directly.

1. Create an empty repository on GitHub and push this folder to it (`node_modules/` is already ignored).
2. On GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch**, choose branch **main** and folder **/ (root)**, and save.
3. After a minute the game is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

Whenever you change something in `src/`, run `npm run build` before committing so the root `index.html` is up to date. The empty `.nojekyll` file tells GitHub Pages to serve the files as they are.

Repository layout:

```
index.html        the playable game (built, self-contained) ← GitHub Pages serves this
.nojekyll         serve files as-is on GitHub Pages
src/              all source code; src/index.html is the development entry
package.json      scripts: npm run dev / npm run build
vite.config.js    builds src/ into the root index.html
```

## Slow or blank 3D?

The game checks what is drawing the 3D. On computers without a proper graphics driver (Windows then uses the "Microsoft Basic Render Driver", which draws in software), it switches to **Fast** graphics automatically and lowers the resolution while frames are slow. Updating the graphics driver (Intel, AMD or NVIDIA) makes a huge difference. A nearly full hard drive can also make browsers misbehave.

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard / mouse | Touch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move | W A S D or arrow keys | joystick: touch anywhere on the left half |
| Look around | drag with the mouse, wheel to zoom | drag on the right half, pinch with two fingers to zoom |
| Jump | Space | ⤒ button |

## Difficulty levels

| Level | Lessons per station | Experiments | Test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🌱 Explorer | 3 essential pages | one required per station (two at the last one), the rest are bonus | 4 questions, 3 to pass |
| 🔬 Scientist | 5 to 6 pages | all Explorer and Scientist experiments | 6 questions, 4 to pass |
| 🚀 Inventor | 7 to 9 pages, including the real math | all experiments, extra missions | 8 harder questions, 6 to pass |

The level can be changed at any time from the menu. Passed stations stay passed.

The test at each station unlocks only after the player has read every lesson page and completed the required experiments for their level. Every answer comes with an explanation. Failing is fine: the game sends the player back to review and lets them retry with a fresh set of questions.

## The 13 stations

| # | Topic | Hands-on experiments | 3D landmark on the island |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What is AI? | Sort machines into "rules" vs "learning"; write rules for a cat detector (and find out why it's impossible) | Gear rule machine vs glowing learning machine |
| 2 | Data: food for AI | Pixel painter (see the numbers, invert, RGB); label factory (fix wrong labels, watch accuracy rise) | Crates of fruit and a labeling conveyor belt |
| 3 | Features & patterns | Feature explorer: pick chart axes and discover good vs useless features | A 3D feature-space sculpture |
| 4 | Classification (k-nearest neighbors) | Drag a mystery point, change k, see the decision map and outliers | A grid floor with pillars and a golden mystery gem |
| 5 | Training: learning from mistakes | Fit the ice-cream line by hand, then watch gradient descent; the foggy hill (learning rate, overshoot, local minimum, momentum) | **The Loss Valley**: a real bowl where balls roll to the lowest error |
| 6 | The artificial neuron | Neuron lab (weights and bias solve AND / OR / majority); watch a perceptron learn, and fail on XOR | A giant neuron with pulses flowing to the axon |
| 7 | Neural networks & layers | Live neural-network playground with backpropagation (blobs, circle, XOR, spiral) | A layered network sculpture with signals flowing forward |
| 8 | Computer vision | Teach the AI to see: draw shapes, train it, test it; filter lab (convolution, step by step) | Pixel wall of a cat plus its edge-filtered twin |
| 9 | Memorizing vs understanding (overfitting) | The wiggly curve lab: training vs test error, just-right complexity, more data | Two curves over the same dots |
| 10 | Clustering (unsupervised learning) | k-means on a bag of candies, step by step, choosing k, elbow chart | Real kickable balls sitting in three clusters |
| 11 | Learning from rewards (reinforcement learning) | The learning launcher (real projectile physics, with optional air drag); robot maze with Q-learning | **An AI launcher** that learns to hit a floating target by trial and error |
| 12 | Language AI & chatbots | Next word machine (teach it sentences, play with temperature); token chopper | Floating word tiles with next-word probability bars |
| 13 | Fair & safe AI | Safe or not? real-life AI situations; the unfair pet door (fix bias with better data) | A balance of fairness |
| 🏆 | Final Challenge at the Core Tower | One question from every station, then a certificate | The tower's crown lights up |

Also on the island: 30 Data Crystals to collect, each with a fun fact (science, AI history, and Romanian computing pioneers like Grigore Moisil and CIFA-1), plus info signs next to every landmark.

## Island challenges

Besides the experiments in each station's window, every island has a **physical challenge** in the 3D world, solved by moving Bip, pushing and kicking balls, standing on pressure plates and walking patterns. Look for the ⭐ flag and press E to hear the rules (this also puts the pieces back). They are bonus content: the test doesn't depend on them. Solved challenges are counted by the ⭐ counter at the top of the screen and marked on the map.

| # | Challenge | What you do | The idea |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Tag the machines | Tag 5 objects on pedestals as "learns from data" or "follows rules" | Rules vs learning |
| 2 | Label the fruit | Push apples and oranges into the right circles (a green apple is still an apple) | Labels and datasets |
| 3 | Odd one out | Three rounds: find the ball with a different color, size, then weight (push them to feel it) | Features |
| 4 | Be the mystery point | Walk on the grid; your 3 nearest pillars vote red or blue | k-nearest neighbors, decision boundary |
| 5 | Two valleys | Get one ball to rest at the bottom of the Loss Valley and one in the side dip | Global vs local minimum |
| 6 | Wake the neuron | Stand on pressure plates and push balls onto them until the weighted sum passes 0 | Weights and bias |
| 7 | The XOR puzzle | Two plates feed a network with a hidden layer; find when its lamp lights | Why hidden layers matter |
| 8 | Pixel floor | Walk over tiles to switch pixels on and off and copy a picture | Images are numbers |
| 9 | Trust the pattern | Jump along stepping stones over the sea; three of them are invisible | Generalization |
| 10 | Group them yourself | Push unlabeled balls into unnamed circles so similar ones end up together | Clustering |
| 11 | You are the agent | Adjust a launcher's power with buttons and learn from the reward | Reinforcement learning |
| 12 | Walk a sentence | Step on word pads; brighter pads are likelier next words | Next-word prediction |
| 13 | Balance the data | Push balls onto the empty pan until the scale balances | Fair, balanced data |

## Real physics

The world follows real physics, and signs around the hub explain it:

- Gravity is 9.81 m/s². Bip's jump (5.1 m/s) reaches about 1.3 m, just as v²/2g predicts.
- Balls have real masses and sizes (beach ball, soccer ball, basketball, bowling ball). A kick gives every ball the same impulse, so lighter balls fly faster (Newton's second law, Δv = J / m).
- Air drag is quadratic (½ρC<sub>d</sub>Av²), so big light balls slow down quickly.
- Buoyancy uses Archimedes' principle for both water and air: the beach ball and soccer ball float at the right depth, and the bowling ball sinks to the seabed.
- Balls roll without slipping, so they accelerate downhill at g·sinθ / (1 + I/mr²), and they keep spinning in the air.
- Bip is metal, so Bip sinks. Walking into deep water sends Bip back to dry land.
- Bip balances on a ball wheel and leans into acceleration like a real self-balancing robot. The wheel turns at ω = v / r.

### Editing content

Each station lives in `src/content/sN.js`:

- `pages`: lesson pages with `level` (1, 2 or 3), `title`, `text` (supports `**bold**` and `- ` bullet lists), an optional `bip` comment and a `visual` (built-in types like `emoji`, `flow`, `vs`, `timeline`, or a custom canvas drawing function).
- `experiments`: `{ id, req, min }`, where `req` is the first level at which it is required and `min` the first level at which it appears.
- `quiz`: multiple choice (`a` = answers, `c` = index of the right one) or true/false (`tf: true`, `c: true/false`), each with a `level` and an explanation in `why`.

Every text field is an `{ en, ro }` pair.

## Tech

Three.js for 3D, a custom physics engine, plain JavaScript and CSS for the interface, Vite plus `vite-plugin-singlefile` for the one-file build. No images, sounds or models are downloaded: everything is generated in code.
